There is a growing interest in natural remedies and plant-based solutions, yet accurately identifying plants and understanding their properties remains a significant challenge. Existing mobile apps often lack accuracy or require extensive botanical knowledge, limiting their accessibility and usefulness.

### Background

There is a growing interest in natural remedies and plant-based solutions, yet accurately
identifying plants and understanding their properties remains a significant challenge.
Existing mobile apps often lack accuracy or require extensive botanical knowledge, limiting
their accessibility and usefulness. Our project, Herbalyze, aims to revolutionize plant identification and knowledge retrieval.
By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms and extensive botanical databases,
Herbalyze provides users with accurate and detailed information about plants, including
their medicinal properties, potential benefits, and related diseases. This bridges the gap
between plant identification and informed decision-making, empowering users to explore
the plant world confidently.
